# Manuka
Manuka is a streamlined Windows debloater designed with simplicity in mind, offering an optimal balance between optimization, security, and privacy.
> [!NOTE]
> By using this executable, you acknowledge and agree to the terms and conditions outlined in the [license](https://github.com/BuzzedHoney/Manuka/blob/main/LICENSE).

> [!WARNING]
> This application was specifically created for Windows 11 Pro systems, and has minimal testing on other system versions, so it is not guaranteed to function exactly as listed if ran on another version.

# Features
### Optimization
- Removes unnecessary backgrounds processes, bloatware like Edge, Outlook, OneDrive, and much more to free up system resources and storage, while also applying a large variety of optimization tweaks to improve overall system performance, and responsiveness.
### Security
- Enhances built in Windows defenses by enabling and configuring Windows Defender and Firewall for maximum real time protection and network security against the latest collection of malware, exploits, and network threats.
### Privacy
- Stops Microsoft’s surveillance by disabling Telemetry, Recall, Copilot, ads, web suggestions, and other invasive features. A wide range of known tracking domains are blocked at the firewall level, and services tied to Bing, Edge, and Microsoft analytics are blocked.

# Installation
The installation process is very simple. Download the latest version of Manuka via the 'Releases' tab on the right hand side of the page. Once downloaded, open the app, and all the system tweaks will be applied automatically.

I'd say so *(obviously)*, but feel free decompile my app if you really don't trust it — nothing’s obfuscated.

If you're concerned about system damage — don't be. Manuka has been thoroughly tested and only uses safe, reversible methods to apply changes.
