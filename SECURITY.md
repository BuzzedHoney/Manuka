# Security Policy
Security is important, especially when modifying core parts of Windows. While Manuka aims to be as safe as possible, itâ€™s still a powerful tool that can affect system behavior. I recommend creating a restore point before executing.

## Supported Versions
I will only be actively updating and supporting the latest version of Manuka. If you are using a version older than the current latest and have a security concern, I will not reply to you. Please ensure you're on the latest version of Manuka before attempting to report any concerns.

## Reporting a Concern
If you discover a vulnerability, have security concerns, or find something that may harm Windows' functionality, please don't shy away from letting me know as soon as possible.

To report a concern, create an [issue](https://github.com/BuzzedHoney/Manuka/issues/new/choose), or use the [security section](https://github.com/BuzzedHoney/Manuka/security/advisories/new) if you've found a vulnerability, and let me know, in detail, what the concern is, how you found it, and why it's harmful.
